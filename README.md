# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe App

Starting my **app development journey** 🚀 with small steps, I built this **Tic Tac Toe game** 🕹️ as one of my first projects.  
It’s a simple yet fun app that helped me practice **Flutter/Dart** and improve my coding skills.  
Play with your friend 👥 or challenge the computer 🤖!
